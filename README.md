# Nahida Niki Khanam – Portfolio

Software engineer with a background in nonprofit strategy and tech for social good. This site showcases projects I've built during my full-stack training.

I’m interested in software engineering, nonprofit consulting, automation, equity-centered technology, and operational problem-solving.

Projects I’ve built include a podcast GPT tool and a real-time dispatch prototype.

I’m currently learning Swift, Java, and AI-powered workflows.

My professional background spans nonprofit strategy, executive support, and cross-functional project operations.

I’m looking to collaborate on projects that improve systems, expand access, and make people’s lives easier.

My career goal is to become a software engineer and/or administrator who builds tools that are scalable, reliable, and grounded in real-world needs.
